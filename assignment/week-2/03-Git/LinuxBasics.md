# Basics of Linux

## What is Linux?

Linux is a powerful, free, and open-source operating system (OS). It’s based on Unix, an earlier OS.

## UNIX

Unix is an early OS developed by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie at AT&T's Bell Laboratories. Later, AT&T acquired it.

## Emergence of Linux

Linux is inspired by Unix and follows a similar structure. The main differences are in how it manages software and handles installations.

## Emergence of Distros

Distros, or distributions, are different versions of Linux. Think of them like different flavors of ice cream. They all use the Linux kernel but have different graphical interfaces, package managers, and software installation methods.

Popular Linux distros include:
- Ubuntu
- Manjaro
- Fedora
- Pop!_OS
- Zorin
- Arch

## Relation of MacOS with Unix

MacOS is based on Unix, so it supports similar terminal commands. However, it differs in package management, software installation, and its graphical interface.

## Debian vs. RedHat

Two major families of Linux distros are Debian and RedHat:

- **Debian-based distros** use the `apt` package manager and `.deb` files.
- **RedHat-based distros** use the `dnf` package manager and `.rpm` files.

## Why Learn Linux?

Linux is essential for understanding computer science and is widely used on servers and in cloud computing. It's free, open-source, and works on many devices, from computers to Raspberry Pi and even smart appliances.

## Don't Worry About Details

When starting out, focus on learning the basics rather than getting bogged down by technical details. It’s better to spend a little time learning Linux to accomplish your tasks and dive deeper when necessary.
