# Intro to Shell

## Shell Commands vs. Shell Scripting

- **Shell Commands**: These are individual commands you type in the terminal, like `ls` (list files), `cd` (change directory), and `pwd` (print working directory).
- **Shell Scripting**: When you combine multiple shell commands into a file, it creates a script. This script automates tasks, like writing a small program using shell commands.

## Why Use Shell Scripting?

Shell scripting is useful for automating repetitive tasks. Instead of typing commands one by one, you can write a script to handle it automatically. Examples include:
- Automating the compilation of code.
- Setting up a development environment.

## What Are Shells?

A shell is a program that lets you interact with your computer’s kernel (the core part of the OS). It allows you to run commands and programs. In simple terms, a shell is an interface for executing commands.

## What Is REPL?

REPL stands for:
- **Read**: Takes input from the user.
- **Evaluate**: Processes the command.
- **Print**: Shows the result.
- **Loop**: Repeats the process.

Terminals and consoles act like REPL environments. They continuously read commands, evaluate them, print the results, and then wait for the next command.

## What Is a Terminal?

A terminal is a program where you can type and execute shell commands. It’s like a command-line interface where you interact with your computer using text commands.

## Different Types of Shell Environments

Examples of shell environments include:
- **Bash**: Commonly used on Linux.
- **Terminal**: A generic term for command-line interfaces.
- **CMD**: The command prompt in Windows.
- **PowerShell**: An advanced command-line tool for Windows.

## Remembering Commands

You don’t need to remember every command. If you need help with a command, you can type `command --help` to see its usage and options.
